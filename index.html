    <h1>My First Blog</h1>
    <p class="bold-text"> Welcome to my blog about Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan which is popularly known as Pink
        City.
        I lived at my Nani's house in Jaipur for two years. Some of the best moments of my life were spent there with my
        Nani and cousins.
        Join me on my trip down memory lane as I reminisce those precious memories.
